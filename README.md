Project Title: Expense Tracker Application

Project Overview: The Expense Tracker Application is a tool designed to help users manage their personal finances by tracking income, expenses, and savings. The application allows users to categorize transactions, view detailed spending reports, and set financial goals, fostering better money management habits.

Key Features:

User authentication and secure login/logout system. Ability to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries. Categorization of transactions (e.g., food, travel, rent, etc.). Visualizations like pie charts and bar graphs to analyze spending patterns. Monthly budget tracking and alerts when approaching limits. Cloud storage to sync data across devices. Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS Backend: Node.js, Express.js Database: MongoDB Other Tools: Chart.js for data visualization, JWT for authentication, and Git/GitHub for version control. Why This Project: This project is interesting because it addresses a universal problem: personal financial management. By building this application, I will enhance my skills in full-stack development, particularly in working with APIs, database management, and data visualization. Additionally, the project offers an opportunity to improve my understanding of user experience design and secure authentication practices, both of which are highly valuable in modern software development.
